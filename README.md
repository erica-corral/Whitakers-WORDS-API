# Whitakers-Words-API
A web API code repo for my Whitakers project.


Code compiled from https://github.com/mk270/whitakers-words


Binaries were compiled for Ubuntu. If you're curious on how the binaries are made, it is quite simple:
  1. Clone the https://github.com/mk270/whitakers-words repo using git clone from command line. Install libgnat if necessary using apt-get.
  2. Inside the words directory generated by git clone, simply run command "make". There is already a "makefile" that takes care of all the build steps.
  3. Make the file "words" that is generated executable using chmod if needed.
  4. Run "./words (latin word to look up)" to get the definition
  5. Or run "./words ~e (english to latin word)" to get the english search. 

Hosted on Heroku, for use by the Erica Corral Apps

Code used by permission of the original author.


You may notice that English-to-Latin search on Erica Corral apps is severely impeded. This is an issue with the Whitaker's program itself, which appears to have become a bug in recent builds. This issue is being actively discussed at the source repository. See the discussion here: https://github.com/mk270/whitakers-words/issues/123. Unfortunately, as copies of Whitakers 1.97FC, which might have the correct English-Latin functioning don't compile correctly to include English dictionaries, or if they do, I have not been able to make them complie correctly, I am not able to host a separate build on the API to get better English-Latin support.
